# ZDR_Automated
An update to the ZDR arc algorithm which streamlines the process of running it in real time. It replaces the user-defined ZDR threshold with a standardized ZDR anomaly threshold (based on the TRENDSS algorithm) to identify ZDR arcs in different environments, and automatically calculates storm motion and storm orientation. All the user needs to enter is the radar site.
